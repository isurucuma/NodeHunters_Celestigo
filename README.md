# SolarSystem Tours Booking App

Welcome to the SolarSystem Tours Booking App repository! This project was created for the RootCode competition, with the aim of developing a booking application for a company offering tours to other planets in the solar system.

## Project Overview

This repository houses the codebase for a comprehensive booking app that enables users to reserve tours to various planets within our solar system. The project is structured as follows:

- **Frontend:** The frontend of the application has been developed using Next.js, a React framework for building modern web applications.

- **Backend:** The backend is powered by Spring Boot, a Java-based framework that provides a robust foundation for creating web applications. We have integrated Spring Security with JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication and authorization to ensure the security of our API endpoints.

- **Database:** Our data is managed using a MySQL database. The schema and relationships are depicted in the Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams provided below (link to ER diagrams).

- **User Interface:** Material-UI, a popular UI component library, has been utilized to craft a sleek and user-friendly interface for our app.

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these guidelines:

1. **Frontend Setup:** Navigate to the frontend directory and install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install --force
    ```

2. **Backend Setup:**

   - You have the option to run the Spring Boot backend using the provided fat JAR file. Alternatively, you can run it in standalone mode using any Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports Java development.
   - Ensure you configure the MySQL database URL in the properties file to establish the connection.

3. **View Configuration:** For an optimal experience, set the view mode to mobile since the application is designed with mobile users in mind.

That's it! You should now have the SolarSystem Tours Booking App up and running locally.

For any questions, feedback, or issues, feel free to reach out to us. Happy exploring the solar system with our innovative booking app!
