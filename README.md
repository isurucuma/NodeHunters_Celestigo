# Planet Tours Booking App Repository

Welcome to the Planet Tours Booking App repository! This project was created for the **RootCode Company Competition**. The aim of this project is to develop a cutting-edge booking application for a company that offers extraordinary tours to various planets within our solar system.

## Project Overview

In this repository, we have developed a comprehensive solution using the following technologies:

- **Frontend:** The user interface is built using **Next.js**, a popular React framework that provides fast rendering and a great developer experience.

- **Backend:** Our backend is powered by **Spring Boot**, a robust and efficient Java framework, ensuring smooth data flow and business logic implementation.

- **Database:** We've employed a **MySQL** database to store and manage the necessary data for the application.

- **UI Components:** To create visually appealing and consistent user interfaces, we've utilized the **Material-UI** component library.

- **Security:** The API endpoints on the backend are secured using **Spring Security** in combination with **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for authentication and authorization, ensuring a secure user experience.

## Entity Relationship Diagrams

For an in-depth understanding of the system's data structure, you can refer to the proposed **Entity Relationship (ER) diagrams**. You can access the diagrams through this [link](link_to_ER_diagrams).

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Frontend Setup:** Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required dependencies using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:** The Spring Boot backend is available in a **fat jar** format. Alternatively, you can run it in standalone mode using your preferred IDE.

3. **Database Configuration:** Make sure to configure the MySQL database URL in the properties file of the backend to establish a connection.

With these steps completed, your Planet Tours Booking App should be up and running, ready for exploration!
